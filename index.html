                            <hr class="main-line">
                            <p>My name is Tomeka.  <br>I am a 46 year old single mom who lives in Oakland, CA with my 12 year old daughter. <br>I never had the opportunity to go to college or call any of my jobs a career.Two years ago I discovered coding and was introduced to the diversity, inclusiveness and the non-traditional career pathways that much of the Tech Industry is, at the very least open to considering.  After completing my initial coding bootcamp I've flopped, floundered and failed at every attempt I've made so far at finding my niche in Tech.  My journey continues and I havent given up by any means.  To the contrary, I've decided to create this blog to document my ongoing journey with it's many trials and tribulations.  By sharing the triumphs and failures, joy and heatbreak I will no doubt continue to experience along the way as a brand new developer trying to find someone willing to take a chance on me, I hope to shine a little light on the fact that the struggle is real. I hope others looking to break into programming or development or design, without a degree, or later in life, can look here to find inspiration , understanding and an experience they can relate to. If this sounds at all interesting to you then I invite you to come along with me as I search out and try new ways to build my portfolio, new ways to deepen my credibility, new ways to continue learning, new ways to broaden my experience, new ways to grow my network and hopefully a way to make a place for myself in the world of front-end development.</p>

                            <p>As someone with what you could loosly refer to as a background in design, the introduction into programming and development has been an exciting yet challenging journey.  Although never formally trained in design Ive always gravitated towards esthetics, style and creativity.  Ive used my mostly self taught skills to the best of my ability to support myself and my daughter for many years, while living in the birth place of Tech, California's Bay Area. This is no small accomplishment in itself as the cost of living in Oakland, CA has continued to increase exponentially with no signs of stopping.  In order to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table I've had to hustle hard, be creative and keep an eye peeled for any opportunity to get ahead.  I jumped at the chance to participate in a year long bootcamp and internship program with AnnieCannons and havent looked back.  Design and development share many commonalities, such as a focus on problem-solving, creativity, and a solid understanding of the basic principles, but Ive found that learning to code has broaden my scope, extended my abilities, and increased my productivity, allowing me the freedom to create so much more on a larger scale that has the potential to reach a much broader audience!</p>

                            <h2 class="topic">Everyone is Welcome Here Because Diversity Is The Key To New Talent</h2>
                            <hr class="main-line">
                            <p>I love to learn new skills and ways of thinking which has benefited me in many ways as Ive transitioned into development. thrive in this field. However, I am passionate about the potential for technology to have a positive impact on the world, and I am excited to become a part of this innovative and dynamic industry, even if its still only on the outskirts.  One of my favorite things that Ive discoverd along the way about the Tech Industry is that there are many people who have come from non-traditional backgrounds such as my self, who have been succussful.  The thing that makes these people really special and stand out to me is that most of them are very accessible thanks to social media and the internet but ALSO they are often extremely willing to help those following in their footsteps. Whether it be advice, mentoring, networking, tutoring  or something unique Ive found that most people in the industry identifying as minority and/or as non-traditionally educated are willing to give back in some form or another in order to help others succeed as they have.  It is important to support and encourage diversity in the tech industry, as historically underrepresented groups such as women and people of color have faced significant barriers to entry and advancement. By promoting inclusivity and providing equal opportunities, the tech industry can benefit from a wider range of perspectives and experiences, leading to greater innovation and success.</p>

                            <hr class="main-line">
                            <p>The tradition of reaching back to your roots and your community to show others the road of opportunity is something I believe in deeply.  Although I havent yet become widly succsessful or reached a place that others would look to me for any type of authority or guidence on anything really, I believe my experience so far is still valid and worthy. I've learned so much in the last 2 years about development, about design and about myself and I realized that someone woke up this morning on day 1 of this journey and maybe something Ive experienced along the way might help them in some small way.  So I've decided to use this space to share my lessons, accomplishments, failures, inspirations, heros, shortcuts, discoveries, adventures and more along the way.  Ultimately I hope to share relatable stories and information with others whose journies might parallel or reflect my own, and I write with the humble intention that something I share here will in some small way be helpful to someone else.</p>

One of my favorite things that Ive discoverd along the way about the Tech Industry is that there are many people who have come from non-traditional backgrounds such as my self, who have been succussful.  The thing that makes these people really special and stand out to me is that most of them are very accessible thanks to social media and the internet but ALSO they are often extremely willing to help those following in their footsteps. Whether it be advice, mentoring, networking, tutoring  or something unique Ive found that most people in the industry identifying as minority and/or as non-traditionally educated are willing to give back in some form or another in order to help others succeed as they have.  It is important to support and encourage diversity in the tech industry, as historically underrepresented groups such as women and people of color have faced significant barriers to entry and advancement. By promoting inclusivity and providing equal opportunities, the tech industry can benefit from a wider range of perspectives and experiences, leading to greater innovation and success.</p>

                            <h2>A Small Contribution From A Freshman In Development</h2>
                            <hr>
                            <p>The tradition of reaching back to your roots and your community to show others the road of opportunity is something I believe in deeply.  Although I havent yet become widly succsessful or reached a place that others would look to me for any type of authority or guidence on anything really, I believe my experience so far is still valid and worthy. I've learned so much in the last 2 years about development, about design and about myself and I realized that someone woke up this morning on day 1 of this journey and maybe something Ive experienced along the way might help them in some small way.  So I've decided to use this space to share my lessons, accomplishments, failures, inspirations, heros, shortcuts, discoveries, adventures and more along the way.  Ultimately I hope to share relatable stories and information with others whose journies might parallel or reflect my own, and I write with the humble intention that something I share here will in some small way be helpful to someone else.</p>
