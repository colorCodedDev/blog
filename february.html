                            <p class="subtopic">This post will serve to highlight the current relationship between African Americans and Tech.  As Ive mentioned previously I love the welcoming, homey, supportive feeling I get when I think about my career so far in tech.  Many of the professional developers and industry professionals that I have met have been surprisingly, friendly, helpful, often offering a comraderary rarely found in any other competitive industry and as I began to take a closer look into the relationship between African Americans and the Tech industry I began to understand why.</p>
                            <h1>The Current Situation</h1>
                            <hr>
                            <p class="subtopic">African Americans have made significant contributions to the field of computer programming. Despite facing discrimination and barriers to education and employment opportunities, pioneers such as Mark Dean, who co-invented the personal computer, and Katherine Johnson, who calculated trajectories for NASA's space missions, have paved the way for future generations. Today, African Americans continue to make strides in the industry, with individuals like Kimberly Bryant founding organizations like Black Girls Code to empower young girls of color to pursue careers in tech. Their contributions have not only advanced the field of computer programming, but also helped to increase diversity and representation within the industry.  However there is still much to be done to address issues of diversiy, rascism, inequality and fair treatment within the Tech industry for African Americans and others.</p>

                            <p class="subtopic">According to an article by Sarah K. White on <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/304911/5-revealing-statistics-about-career-challenges-black-it-pros-face.html">cio.com, </a>between 2014 and 2021, the tech industry only increased black representation by 1%, according to data from the Kapor Center. Black workers are also paid 4% less than their peers and often hired into lower-level roles than they are qualified for. Black tech talent represents only 4.4% of board roles, 3.7% of technical roles, and 4% of executive leadership.</p>

These groups are called unrepresented because the number of people identifying as a part of these groups is signifigantly less than those who do not.  Those who do not include people who identify as white (who make up 67% of the tech industry) and Asian (who currently make up 20% of the tech industry).  That leaves just 13% to be divided among the rest of us.</p>

More specifically last year, 42.8% of the people hired at Google in 2021 were Asian, 8.8% were Black, 8.8% were Latinx, and 0.7% were Native American.</p>

In a 2022 report, State of Tech Diversity: The Black Tech Ecosystem, the Kapor Center found that nearly half of all Black technologists reported experiencing racial inequity in hiring, promotion, leadership opportunities, and salaries and benefits.  This results in lass time black tech talent is spending in their roles and higher turnover. A study from The Kapor Center for Social Impact and The Ford Foundation found unfair treatment to be the top driver of employee turnover, in particular for employees from underrepresented groups. More than one in three Black participants in the 2017 survey said they left a job or company due to unfairness within the past year.<br><span class="references">https://www.cio.com/article/304911/5-revealing-statistics-about-career-challenges-black-it-pros-face</span></p>

Having diverse representation at the top levels of any organization means that everyone has a voice and that a multitude of perspectives contribute to making fair decisions and changes for everyone.

Although many opportunities have begun to emerge for education in the form of schoalorships and apprentiships, it isn't enough,learning and education are only part of the problem.  Hiring quotas and the push to show black representation within their companies isn't really working either because once they are hired black talent often finds after landing roles in tech that a fair playing field still does not exsist. Most blacks currently working in tech report a lack of opportunity to progress and achieve recognition and/or promotion in their careers with 29% reporting that they are happy with the opportunities presented to them in their careers to date, compared to 52% of non-Black tech professionals with the same level of experience.</p>

Looking over the numbers in black and white it is hard to deny that the industry is not necessarily operating in the way that it portrays itself to be.  Then again, who isn't.  A part of me (the naive and forgiving part) feels that everyone does this to some extent throught the day and as long as they are striving to improve and become the inclusive and progressive industry they want us to believe that they are then there is hope.  Change and progress are slow and historically have only been made to travel faster through hard work, standing up for whats right, speaking out against wrong doing and exemplifying the change that we want to see and so, in conclusion, it means that there is still much work to be done. </p>

In a 2022 report, State of Tech Diversity: The Black Tech Ecosystem, the Kapor Center found that nearly half of all Black technologists reported experiencing racial inequity in hiring, promotion, leadership opportunities, and salaries and benefits.  This results in lass time black tech talent is spending in their roles and higher turnover. A study from The Kapor Center for Social Impact and The Ford Foundation found unfair treatment to be the top driver of employee turnover, in particular for employees from underrepresented groups. More than one in three Black participants in the 2017 survey said they left a job or company due to unfairness within the past year.<br><span class="references">https://www.cio.com/article/304911/5-revealing-statistics-about-career-challenges-black-it-pros-face</span></p>

Hiring quotas and the push to show black representation within their companies isn't really working either because once they are hired black talent often finds after landing roles in tech that a fair playing field still does not exsist. Most blacks currently working in tech report a lack of opportunity to progress and achieve recognition and/or promotion in their careers with 29% reporting that they are happy with the opportunities presented to them in their careers to date, compared to 52% of non-Black tech professionals with the same level of experience.</p>

Looking over the numbers in black and white it is hard to deny that the industry is not necessarily operating in the way that it portrays itself to be.  Then again, who isn't.  A part of me (the naive and forgiving part) feels that everyone does this to some extent throught the day and as long as they are striving to improve and become the inclusive and progressive industry they want us to believe that they are then there is hope.  Change and progress are slow and historically have only been made to travel faster through hard work, standing up for whats right, speaking out against wrong doing and exemplifying the change that we want to see and so, in conclusion, it means that there is still much work to be done. </p>

                            <p class="subtopic">This post will serve to highlight the current relationship between African Americans and Tech.  As Ive mentioned previously I love the welcoming, homey, supportive feeling I get when I think about my career so far in tech.  Many of the professional developers and industry professionals that I have met have been surprisingly, friendly, helpful, often offering a comraderary rarely found in any other competitive industry and as I began to take a closer look into the relationship between African Americans and the Tech industry I began to understand why.</p>
                            <h1>The Current Situation</h1>
                            <hr>
                            <p class="subtopic">African Americans have made significant contributions to the field of computer programming. Despite facing discrimination and barriers to education and employment opportunities, pioneers such as Mark Dean, who co-invented the personal computer, and Katherine Johnson, who calculated trajectories for NASA's space missions, have paved the way for future generations. Today, African Americans continue to make strides in the industry, with individuals like Kimberly Bryant founding organizations like Black Girls Code to empower young girls of color to pursue careers in tech. Their contributions have not only advanced the field of computer programming, but also helped to increase diversity and representation within the industry.  However there is still much to be done to address issues of diversiy, rascism, inequality and fair treatment within the Tech industry for African Americans and others.</p>

Black workers are also paid 4% less than their peers and often hired into lower-level roles than they are qualified for. Black tech talent represents only 4.4% of board roles, 3.7% of technical roles, and 4% of executive leadership.</p>

In a 2022 report, State of Tech Diversity: The Black Tech Ecosystem, the Kapor Center found that nearly half of all Black technologists reported experiencing racial inequity in hiring, promotion, leadership opportunities, and salaries and benefits.  This results in lass time black tech talent is spending in their roles and higher turnover. A study from The Kapor Center for Social Impact and The Ford Foundation found unfair treatment to be the top driver of employee turnover, in particular for employees from underrepresented groups. More than one in three Black participants in the 2017 survey said they left a job or company due to unfairness within the past year.<br><span class="references">https://www.cio.com/article/304911/5-revealing-statistics-about-career-challenges-black-it-pros-face</span></p>

Although many opportunities have begun to emerge for education in the form of schoalorships and apprentiships, it isn't enough,learning and education are only part of the problem.  Hiring quotas and the push to show black representation within their companies isn't really working either because once they are hired black talent often finds after landing roles in tech that a fair playing field still does not exsist. Most blacks currently working in tech report a lack of opportunity to progress and achieve recognition and/or promotion in their careers with 29% reporting that they are happy with the opportunities presented to them in their careers to date, compared to 52% of non-Black tech professionals with the same level of experience.</p>

Looking over the numbers in black and white it is hard to deny that the industry is not necessarily operating in the way that it portrays itself to be.  Then again, who isn't.  A part of me (the naive and forgiving part) feels that everyone does this to some extent throught the day and as long as they are striving to improve and become the inclusive and progressive industry they want us to believe that they are then there is hope.  Change and progress are slow and historically have only been made to travel faster through hard work, standing up for whats right, speaking out against wrong doing and exemplifying the change that we want to see and so, in conclusion, it means that there is still much work to be done. </p>
