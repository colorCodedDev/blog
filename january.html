                    <hr>
                    <p class="subtopic">It's never too late to identify your passion and pursue it. With some introspection and exploration, you can find something that truly lights you up and gives your life purpose.  For me that something is making beautiful things come to life on the web.</p>
                    <h2 class="topic">Reflect On Your Interests</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="subtopic">Start by figuring out what you love doing. This can be anything from writing to cooking to playing sports.  Once you've identified your passion, it can be a guiding force in your life.Think about the things that make you happy, even if they don't seem like they could be a career or hobby. What activities do you enjoy doing in your free time? What topics do you find yourself reading about or watching videos on?</p>
                    <h2 class="topic">Consider Your Values</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="subtopic">What's important to you? What do you believe in? Your passion should align with your values, so take some time to think about what those are.  Try new things: Don't be afraid to step outside of your comfort zone and try something new. You never know what you might discover that you're passionate about!</p>

                    <h2 class="topic">A College Degree vs. Educating Yourself</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="subtopic">Being self-taught and Black in tech can present many unique challenges. The lack of representation and diversity in the industry can make it diffcult to find relatable role models or mentors. Additionally, access to resources and opportunities may be limited, leading to a steeper learning curve. However, it is important to acknowledge and celebrate the resilience and determination required to pursue a career in tech despite these challenges. By sharing experiences and supporting one another, the tech industry can become more inclusive and diverse.
                    </p>
                    <p class="subtopic">Getting into tech without a college degree is possible, but it requires a lot of hard work and dedication. One way to start is by learning coding skills through online resources such as Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, or Udemy. Networking and building relationships with people in the industry can also be helpful. It's important to have a portfolio of projects to showcase your skills and experience. Additionally, being self-motivated and constantly seeking new knowledge and skills will be crucial in this field. Keep in mind that some companies may still require a college degree, but there are plenty of opportunities available for self-taught individuals in the tech industry.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p class="subtopic">Networking can be a powerful tool when trying to break into a new industry. Start by researching industry events, conferences, and meetups in your area or online. Attend these events and make an effort to meet new people, ask questions, and exchange contact information. Use social media platforms like LinkedIn to connect with professionals in your desired industry and reach out to them for informational interviews or job shadowing opportunities. Joining industry-specific groups or organizations can also provide valuable networking opportunities. Remember to always be professional, respectful, and genuine in your interactions with others.</p>

                    <h2 class="topic">Networking As An Older Person In Your Industry</h2>
                    <p class="subtopic">Breaking into any industry can be a challenging endeavor, especially for older individuals who may face ageism and other barriers. However, it is important to remember that age doesn't necessarily determine one's ability to learn and adapt. I find this to be especially true in tech. With dedication, persistence, and a willingness to continuously learn and improve, it is possible to succeed in the tech industry at any age. Seeking out mentorship, networking with professionals in the industry, and gaining relevant skills through online courses or bootcamps can also help older individuals break into tech.</p>
